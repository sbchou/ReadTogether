Listen, zombie. Believe me. What I could tell you—you with your silly hands leaking
sweat on your growth-stocks portfolio. One-ten lousy hacks of AT&T on twentypoint
margin and you think you’re Evel Knievel. AT&T? You doubleknit dummy, how
I’d love to show you something.
Look, dead daddy, I’d say. See for instance that rotten girl?
In the crowd over there, that one gaping at her gods. One rotten girl in the city
of the future. (That’s what I said.) Watch.
She’s jammed among bodies, craning and peering with her soul yearning out of her
eyeballs. Love! Oo-ooh, love them! Her gods are coming out of a store called Body
East. Three young-bloods, larking along loverly. Dressed like simple street-people
but… smashing. See their great eyes swivel above their nose-filters, their hands li
shyly, their inhumanly tender lips melt? The crowd moans. Love! This whole boiling
megacity, this whole fun future world loves its gods.
You don’t believe gods, dad? Wait. Whatever turns you on, there’s a god in the
future for you, custom-made. Listen to this mob. “I touched his foot. Ow-oow, I
TOUCHED Him!”
Even the people in the GTX tower up there love the gods—in their own way and
for their own reasons.
The funky girl on the street, she just loves. Grooving on their beautiful lives, their
mysterioso problems. No one ever told her about mortals who love a god and end up
as a tree or a sighing sound. In a million years it’d never occur to her that her gods
might love her back.
She’s squashed against the wall now as the godlings come by.
They move in a clear space. A holocam bobs above but its shadow never falls on
them. The store display screens are magically clear of bodies as the gods glance in
and a beggar underfoot is suddenly alone. They give him a token. “Aaaaah!” goes the
crowd.
